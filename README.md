# drake_simulator
Perform MCMC analysis of Drake equation using different assumptions.

The approach taken here is largely derived from the work of Anders Sandberg (Oxford University), while the updates to the distributions used in the Drake equation are largely influenced by several papers by David Kipping (Columbia University).
